MCode_Generator

A simply software in C# that i made for my job in my actual company.
It simplifies a part of my tasks.
It read data from a .csv file*, elaborate and format it, and create a .txt files in output with the code to use inside the IDE of the PLC 
that my company use for their machines.

*This .csv file need to be in the same folder of the software. An example of the .csv file is inside the folder called "codM".
